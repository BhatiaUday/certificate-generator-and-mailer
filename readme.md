# How to run

1. Make venv
2. Activate venv
3. Install requirments
4. Setup config
5. Run python script

## The python code has some comments for how to enable/disable printing/mailing etc, read that code. I was too lazy to make a CLI since i just had to email these certificates at 2 am after an event :smiley:
